				<h1>It's Over</h1>
				<p>The attack ends as suddenly as it began. All that remains is
				the smoke and the rubble. You tense as you think about the ones
				that got through your defense. Hopefully you bought some time
				to evacuate...</p>
				<p>This isn't why you're here. You wanted to protect people.
				But, when time came, you couldn't protect everyone. Deep
				inside, you know you actually could have saved everyone, if
				only you had done better. If only you had aimed that missile
				properly, or not failed to notice that city until it was too
				late. If only you could try it again.</p>
				<p>You glance down at the Z Button. Maybe you still can.
				After all, it's not like you care about demerits anyway.</p>
