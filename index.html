			<p style="margin-top: 20px"><span class="lead">It's been a quiet
			shift tonight.</span> Then again, it always is. When you first
			started this assignment as an operator of the Primary Obstacle
			Missile Platform (or POMP&mdash;those R&amp;D guys love their
			acronyms), you spent your shifts with your eyes glued to your
			display screen, expecting any minute to see dozens of red blips
			appear. The POMP Defense System protects major cities across the
			whole region, and with politics the way they've been
			recently...</p>
			<p>You blink. That was just melodrama on your part. You soon
			learned that nothing ever happens. You liked the idea of this
			job&mdash;you were never a very good soldier, but you wanted to
			protect people. When the opening came up, you submitted a transfer
			request immediately.  Now, shoved in a back room and staring at a
			cramped screen, you realize that being a POMP operator is the type
			of position typically assigned as punishment. That explains why the
			transfer was so quickly accepted. Even still, you try to keep your
			spirits up. After all, at least you're still (in theory) protecting
			people.</p>
			<p>An alarm buzzes. You almost don't hear it. It's supposed to
			indicate incoming hostile munitions have been detected, but the
			disfunctional scrap of junk metal goes off several times a night.
			You've learned to ignore it. It's strange&mdash;the POMP itself is
			an incredible feat of engineering, and a tribute to modern
			balistics and sensors. On your desk is some new device the guys in
			R&amp;D have been working on. They call it the "Z Button", and
			while you haven't been to the training yet, you've heard it can
			mess with time itself, of all the crazy things. Yet your alarm
			can't seem to tell the difference between incoming explosives and
			a cumulous cloud.</p>
			<p>The alarm buzzes again. You blink again. That's unusual; it
			rarely goes off twice in a row. It buzzes again. And again. And
			then begins a continuous drone. You glance down at your controls,
			then at the Z Button, and then at your screen.</p>

			<h3>POMP Operating Instructions:</h3>
			<ul class="list-unstyled">
				<li>Left click, A &mdash; Fire missile from left silo to cursor's position</li>
				<li>Right click, D &mdash; Fire missile from right silo to cursor's position</li>
				<li>Z &mdash; Press the Z Button
			</ul>

			<p>Cities are indicated by grey rectangles, and POMP silos by red
			semicircles. The green number above each silo indicates how many
			remaining missiles are in the silo. POMP missiles will detonate
			upon reaching their targeted position. The explosion should destroy
			any nearby incoming enemy munitions. If an enemy munition reaches
			its target, it will detonate, effectively destroying the target.</p>
			<p>Due to the potential paradoxical implications of its use, the Z
			Button is only to be used by properly trained operators, and only
			then in extreme circumstances. Unauthorized use of the Z Button
			will result in a demerit and an incident report being filed along
			with the nightly log.</p>
