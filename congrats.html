			explodes like a firework in the sky</span>. You scan your display,
			but all is quiet. You slowly relax. Even the alarm ceases its
			droning.</p>

			<p>It all happened so fast; barely anyone had a chance to respond.
			Now that you're not zeroed in on your screen, you notice a slow din
			of confusion rising from the rest of the base as people try to
			figure out what just happened.</p>

			<p>Regardless of what they decide, and what makes it into the
			nightly log, you know what happened. Thanks to your perseverence,
			not a single life was lost in the attack. When all seemed lost, and
			you were overwhelemd and nearly overcome, you continued fighting.
			And you succeeded.</p>
